        <p>Prior to 1954, gunshot effects in drama were made firing a
          real gun in front of a microphone. Guns could easily damage
          microphones, scare performers and had safety implications.
        </p>

        <p>The BBC Designs Department produced a successful electronic
          alternative which sounded realistic and was capable of being used for
          a broad range of sounds which could not be made naturally.
